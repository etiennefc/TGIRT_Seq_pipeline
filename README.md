## Software to install
Conda (Miniconda3) needs to be installed (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

For Linux users :
```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Answer `yes` to `Do you wish the installer to initialize Miniconda3?`


To create the Snakemake environment used to launch Snakemake, run the following. The `conda create` command can appear to be stuck on `Solving environment`. While we are actually arguably [never going to solve the environment](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/), the command is probably not stuck. Just be patient.

```bash
exec bash
conda config --set auto_activate_base False
conda create --name smake -c bioconda -c conda-forge snakemake=7.18
```

Before running Snakemake, you have to initialize the environment
```bash
conda activate smake
```


## Run

If the cluster nodes do not have internet access, run firstly the tasks requiring the internet locally (i.e all downloads) from the workflow directory with :
```bash
snakemake all_downloads --profile ../profile_local/
```


To run the workflow locally simply run the following command in the Snakemake conda environment from the workflow directory.
```bash
snakemake --profile ../profile_local/
```

To run on a Slurm cluster, one can use the following command to run (queue) all tasks at once from the workflow directory. Don't forget to change mail-user address for your own email address in cluster.yaml (in the profile_slurm directory).
```bash
snakemake --profile ../profile_slurm/
```

To look at your entire workflow in svg, use the following commands (combined or separate conditions respectively):
```bash
snakemake --rulegraph | dot -Tsvg | display
snakemake --dag | dot -Tsvg | display
```
